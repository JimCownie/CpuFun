# CpuFun Code Snippets
This repository contains small snippets of code that have been used in the [CPUFun](https://cpufun.substack.com) blog.

These are intended to help you to understand the points made in the blog, rather than being production quality code! (So they are unlikely to have CMAKE files :-), though there may be a small `Makefile`).

In some cases the code may not constitute a whole program, but just a sample that is interesting in its own right, or is intended to be pasted into [Compiler Explorer](https://godbolt.org/) for compiled code investigation.
